The x axis of this graph shows the twelve months of the past year
while ours sales in millions of dollars appear on the y axis.
It maybe seen clearly that sales rose steadily in the first half of the year(from January to May)
and reached their peak in June. Then they dropped off in July and levelled out in August.
After rising sharply during September, they suffered a dramatic fall in October but
then made a moderate recovery in November. However, the year ended with a slight downturn.
